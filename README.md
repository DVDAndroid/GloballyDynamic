**A set of tools geared towards making [Dynamic Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/dynamic-delivery) universally available, regardless of underlying 
App Store / distribution platform, while also providing a single unified Android client API and a streamlined developer experience.
<br/><br/>Currently supported platforms include:**
* Google Play Store ([Dynamic Delivery](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle/dynamic-delivery))
* Huawei App Gallery ([Dynamic Ability](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-featuredelivery-introduction))
* Most other platforms in combination with [GloballyDynamic Server](globallydynamic-server-lib) (e.g. Amazon App Store, Samsung Galaxy Store, Firebase App Distribution or during local development)

Why?
---
Dynamic delivery is great, it can go a long way towards saving device storage space as well as network consumption for users. However, it poses a few problems:
* If you want to leverage capabilities such as Dynamic Feature Modules for multiple platforms, you have to provide a 
*separate client side integration for each app store you distribute through that supports dynamic delivery* - with current trends pointing towards an increasingly scattered landscape of app stores 
(e.g. Huawei and Amazon devices come without Play Store installed), the problem is likely to get magnified in the future.

* Many app stores do not support app bundles, if you distribute through any of these you are ultimately forced to provide
a version of your app with a user experience different from the one you provide on Play Store (assuming that you use Dynamic Delivery on Play Store)

* It can not be used if your device does not have an app store with native support for dynamic delivery installed, or if your app is distributed through a platform without support for dynamic delivery (e.g. Amazon App Store, Galaxy Store, Firebase App Distribution etc.).

*GloballyDynamic is an attempt to address these problems by: 
A) Making Dynamic Delivery universally available. B) Providing a unified client api for all underlying app store client
libraries. <br/>C) Providing tools that make for a streamlined developer experience.* 

Key capabilities
---
* **Unified client API**: write once, run with any platform supporting dynamic delivery. The 
[Android Library](globallydynamic-android-lib) comes in different flavors that each expose an identical API, but delegate to a 
different underlying app store client API (e.g Play Core or Dynamic Ability)

* **Dynamic delivery for distribution platforms without support for app bundles**: e.g. Samsung Galaxy Store, 
Amazon App Store. This is made available by interplay between [GloballyDynamic Server](globallydynamic-server-lib), 
the [Android Library](globallydynamic-android-lib) and the [Gradle Plugin](globallydynamic-gradle-plugin).

* **Dynamic delivery during development**: download and install split APK:s (Dynamic feature APK:s, configuration APK:s etc.) 
from a server running locally in Android Studio during development, without having to upload bundles to a distribution 
platform (e.g. Google Play or Huawei App Gallery) or manually build/install splits to your device. Made available by the
[Android Studio Plugin](globallydynamic-studio-plugin)

* **Dynamic delivery with any device**: utilize dynamic delivery for devices that do not have an app store with dynamic delivery support installed (e.g. emulators w/o Google Play or custom devices).

* **Dynamic delivery for internal builds**: utilize dynamic delivery for internally distributed builds, e.g. builds distributed through [Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution), before they get promoted to other distribution platforms.

* **Throttle the download speed of split APK:s during development**: configure the development server to download APK:s slower, allowing for easier testing of download dialogs and cancellation of downloads through system notifications.
